				<h2>Behaviour Measurement & Change.</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>In this area we are building on existing research programmes at the interface between data science and health and performance. This research brings data scientists together to work with experts in health and sports science to address challenges in measurement, understanding and influencing behaviour and performance in health and sport. In particular we are interested in furthering our development of (1) Strategies for objective, reliable and sensitive measurement and understanding of macro and micro level behaviours in health and sports performance contexts, (2) Data visualisation tools that effectively communicate insights to different stakeholders and (3) Personalised and adaptive recommendations for behaviour change and performance enhancement. This research programme is framed around 3 interdisciplinary projects; (1) Optimising athlete performance in running, (2) Measurement and management of chronic pain, and (3) Enhancing lifestyle management and learning behaviours in students.</p>
				<p>In 2020 we plan to recruit a number of PhD students and postdoctoral researchers to work together on these projects. We are seeking applications from candidates with backgrounds in data science, biomedical engineering, clinical/sport science, and social science. Areas of interest include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Development of models for knowledge discovery in large, complex, multi modal datasets, or sparse, incomplete datasets related to behaviour</li>
					<li>Computational modelling of explanation strategies (factual, semi-factual or counterfactual approaches)</li>
					<li>Development and evaluation of data visualization strategies to facilitate enhanced understanding of longitudinal actigraphy datasets</li>
					<li>Development of frameworks for objective measurement of behaviour using multimodal data sources.</li>
					<li>Multivariate time series classification and regression applied to data from wearable motion sensors in sports performance measurement contexts</li>
					<li>Development of personalised and adaptive recommendations for behaviour change in chronic pain (or lifestyle management)</li>
					<li>Human/data interaction in behaviour measurement/change</li>
					<li>Development and validation of care pathways that leverage novel behaviour measurement frameworks</li>
					<li>Clinical validation of time series classification and regression models in health and sports</li>
					<li>Artificial imagination for improved motor planning during robotic manipulation</li>
					<li>Agile evaluation strategies</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Medical Imaging</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>This strand of research brings together investigators from across the Insight Centre, in collaboration with various clinical experts to develop novel deep learning approaches for a variety of medical applications. The research builds on the wide experience in the Insight Centre to address challenges in developing better deep learning models for medical image analysis, the application of these models to clinical tasks, and using interpretability and explainability to assist the clinician’s workflow.
					In particular we are interested in the following areas:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>State of the art segmentation models for medical image analysis, applied to different modalities (MRI, CT, Xray, etc).</li>
					<li>Data augmentation methods, GAN for image generation and enhanced model training</li>
					<li>Joint learning, combining image data with medical reports</li>
					<li>Time series analysis, LSTM’s</li>
					<li>Interpretability and explainability, saliency</li>
				</ul>
				<p>We are seeking applications for both postdoctoral and PhD positions.
					We are looking for candidates with a demonstrated interest in machine learning, deep learning and medical image analysis. Some interest in clinical applications is also useful.
					Good communication skills are necessary and some expertise in software development, particularly python and the deep learning frameworks tensor flow, pytorch etc.

				<h2>Cultural Analytics</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Cultural Analytics involves collaborative research between data analytics and humanities, using advanced machine learning techniques to create new modes of understanding of complex cultural and historical datasets. It offers the opportunity to work at a transhistorical, and trans-disciplinary level to analyse a very broad range of digital archives and corpora. Datasets here are naturally multi-modal, encompassing sources such as historical and contemporary text corpora, large collections of images including illustrations and photographs, audio archives, and archives of online material. This interdisciplinary research naturally brings together researchers from the humanities and data analytics in order to study and address societal issues in areas such as public health and migration. A key objective of the work will be to develop new computational methods which include a “human in the loop” element, allowing domain expertise to be incorporated in an effective and trustworthy manner.</p>
				<p>In 2020 we plan to recruit a number of PhD students to work on different aspects of these challenges. Areas of interest include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Text mining and natural language processing of historical text corpora.</li>
					<li>Digital approaches to literary texts, coming from a literary studies perspective.</li>
					<li>Constructing knowledge graphs and network representations from textual data.</li>
					<li>Machine learning on multimodal data, including text, images, and network data.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>We are also seeking applications for several postdoctoral roles, where applicants should have experience in one of the following areas:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A PhD in Computer Science or Statistics, with general expertise in machine learning and specific expertise in text mining and natural language processing</li>
					<li>A PhD in English with a specialism in Victorian literature and culture, and will ideally have experience of Cultural Analytics approaches to literary texts, within a collaborative interdisciplinary research environment.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Smart & Sustainable Agriculture</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>As part of its role in the SFI Vistamilk Research Centre, we are also seeking applications for PhD scholarships in topics that are aligned to the mission of Vistamilk. Vistamilk seeks to facilitate the development and deployment of new knowledge, new technologies and new decision support tools to maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of the entire dairy production chain. It achieves this through the development of new, and advanced existing electronic monitoring and actuation technologies to transform an already world-class dairy sector into a global leader in sustainable Agri-Tech. In this recruitment round we are interested in the following topics:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Machine learning for smart agriculture</li>
					<li>Genetic selection for more environmentally friendly dairy cows through improved nitrogen use efficiency</li>
				</ul>
